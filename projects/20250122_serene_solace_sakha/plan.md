Here’s a milestone-based roadmap to guide your project development:

---

### **Phase 1: Research and Planning**
1. **Define Scope and Objectives**  
   - Finalize the chatbot’s purpose, boundaries, and core functionalities (e.g., emotional check-ins, activity suggestions).  
   - Identify target audience and their needs.  

2. **Choose Tools and Technology Stack**  
   - Select the appropriate LLM platform (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face).  
   - Plan infrastructure for personalization (e.g., database for user preferences).  

3. **Design Personality and Behavior**  
   - Define bot persona (name, tone, style).  
   - Write a system prompt to guide behavior.  

4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**  
   - Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.).  
   - Develop disclaimers and ethical boundaries for emotional support.

### **Phase 2: Prototype Development**
1. **Core Features**  
   - Build a framework for initial personalization (ask targeted questions in first chat).  
   - Implement empathetic and supportive response generation using LLMs.  
   - Define fallback and escalation strategies for distressing inputs (e.g., directing to professional resources).  

2. **Database Integration**  
   - Create a system to store user preferences securely for personalized suggestions.  

3. **Safety Mechanisms**  
   - Implement filters for sensitive or harmful language.  
   - Develop response templates for distress scenarios, including redirection to helplines.

### **Phase 3: Testing and Iteration**
1. **Prototype Evaluation**  
   - Test the chatbot internally using AI-based evaluation and predefined benchmarks (relevance, empathy, safety).  
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders and improve the bot.  

2. **Beta Launch**  
   - Release the bot to a small group of users for real-world testing.  
   - Collect user feedback on empathy, personalization, and usability.  

3. **Iterate Based on Feedback**  
   - Refine conversation flows, improve personalization, and enhance safety mechanisms.

### **Phase 4: Full Development**
1. **Scale Features**  
   - Add more activity suggestions based on user preferences.  
   - Improve personalization by training a lightweight user model (optional).  

2. **Enhance Accessibility**  
   - Optimize the bot for multiple platforms (mobile, web, chat apps).  

3. **Polish UI/UX**  
   - Design a user-friendly interface for chat interactions.  
   - Include visuals or interactive elements if needed.  

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**
1. **Public Launch**  
   - Deploy the chatbot on the chosen platform(s).  
   - Announce its availability to the target audience.  

2. **Monitor and Maintain**  
   - Set up analytics to track usage, satisfaction, and response quality.  
   - Continuously update the bot with new activities and suggestions.  
   - Regularly review flagged conversations for safety improvements.  

---

### **Phase 6: Expansion**
1. **Localization**  
   - Add support for multiple languages if needed.  

2. **Additional Features**  
   - Introduce seasonal or event-based suggestions (e.g., holiday activities).  
   - Expand resource database with location-specific professional help options.  

3. **Community Engagement**  
   - Build a community of users to gather insights and improve the bot.
