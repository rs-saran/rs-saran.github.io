### Introduction 
In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals struggle with feelings of stress, loneliness, and emotional overwhelm. While professional therapy is invaluable for addressing deep-seated issues, not everyone requires—or has access to—such resources. Often, a simple, empathetic check-in or a comforting suggestion can go a long way in improving someone’s mood or helping them feel supported.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a chatbot designed to act as a caring friend. It will check in on users’ well-being, provide personalized activity suggestions, and offer emotional support through warm and understanding conversations. The goal is not to replace professional help but to provide a friendly, non-judgmental space where users can feel heard and gently encouraged to engage in activities that bring them joy and comfort.
