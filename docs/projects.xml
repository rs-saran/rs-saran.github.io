<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In today’s fast-paced world, many of us silently wrestle with stress, loneliness, and emotional overwhelm. Therapy is a powerful avenue for healing, but not everyone needs—or can access—that level of care. Sometimes, all it takes is a gentle check-in, a thoughtful nudge, or the simple comfort of feeling seen.</p>
<p>That’s where Sakha began. Not as a replacement for professional help, but as a small, caring presence—always there, always listening. A friend in your pocket, ready to ask how you’re doing, suggest something that might lift your mood, or simply sit with you in a moment of stillness.</p>
<p>The vision was simple yet ambitious: create a chatbot that doesn’t just respond, but genuinely cares. One that offers warmth, understanding, and personalized encouragement—without judgment, pressure, or pretense.</p>
<p>The name Sakha, meaning “friend” in Sanskrit, wasn’t chosen lightly. It reflected the heart of what I wanted this project to embody: a companion who listens, nudges, and supports without judgment. Someone who remembers that you enjoy walks when you’re anxious, or that music lifts your mood when you’re feeling off.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of the Project</strong></p>
<p>A human friend can do many things—offer advice, share personal experiences, comfort you in tough times, or challenge your ideas. The list goes on and on, and no chatbot could hope to replicate all of that depth.</p>
<p>With Sakha, the aim wasn’t to do everything a human friend does but to offer a <em>starting point</em>—a focused subset of what a caring friend might provide in the everyday moments when you just need a check-in, a small nudge, or a reminder to care for yourself.</p>
<p>Key functions included: - Checking in on your emotional well-being. - Suggesting activities to boost mood or break a cycle of stress. - Offering a non-judgmental space to reflect or receive gentle reminders.</p>
<p>It’s a limited scope, yes, but it’s a foundation—one that can evolve over time as we explore more complex interactions, while keeping things simple and meaningful in the beginning.</p>
<p>Thanks for the details—that’s super helpful. Here’s how I suggest we structure the rest of the blog, staying true to your voice and reflecting the actual journey you had. The tone will still be narrative but will sneak in technical insights through storytelling, not a dry dump.</p>

<section id="where-do-you-even-start" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-do-you-even-start"><strong>Where Do You Even Start?</strong></h3>
<p>I didn’t set out with a 100-step master plan. Like most projects, Sakha started with a question: <em>How do I make a chatbot feel like a friend—not just in tone, but in behavior?</em> I knew I needed something flexible, expressive, and capable of holding a conversation in a way that didn’t feel robotic. That naturally pointed me toward LLMs.</p>
</section>
<section id="choosing-the-mind-llms-and-how-i-picked-mine" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choosing-the-mind-llms-and-how-i-picked-mine"><strong>Choosing the Mind – LLMs and How I Picked Mine</strong></h3>
<p>With dozens of options, the choice wasn’t easy. GPT-4? Claude? LLaMA? Each model had tradeoffs in terms of access, pricing, and openness. Eventually, I chose to use open-source LLMs hosted through <strong>Groq’s API</strong>. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Groq’s inference speeds were impressive.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: It supports open-source models like LLaMA3.3, which means I’m not locked into one ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Future-ready</strong>: I can always self-host these models later if needed, thanks to their open-source nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrapped this through <strong>LangChain</strong>, which made it super easy to swap out models during experimentation and build proofs-of-concept quickly without worrying about underlying LLM plumbing.</p>

<section id="langgraph-giving-structure-to-conversations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="langgraph-giving-structure-to-conversations"><strong>LangGraph – Giving Structure to Conversations</strong></h3>
<p>Once I picked the brain, I needed to figure out how to guide it. Not every conversation should be flat and linear—some needed state, branching logic, and even tool use.</p>
<p>That’s where <strong>LangGraph</strong> came in.</p>
<ul>
<li>It lets me create multi-step workflows.</li>
<li>I can embed conditional logic into conversations (e.g., “Is the user in distress?” → switch flow).</li>
<li>It gives me conversational memory for continuity.</li>
<li>And it integrates smoothly with external tools and APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>LangGraph powers Sakha’s <strong>conversation graph</strong>—the engine that routes how chats progress depending on context and user state.</p>

<section id="why-flask-for-the-ui" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-flask-for-the-ui"><strong>Why Flask for the UI?</strong></h3>
<p>I kept the frontend simple—just a few HTML pages with some JavaScript—but even that needed a stable backend.</p>
<p><strong>Flask</strong> fit perfectly: - Lightweight and quick to set up - Easy to plug into Python-based LLM pipelines - Great for rapid prototyping and deployment</p>
<p>It let me focus on core logic without worrying about UI framework overhead.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-internals-a-quick-tour"><strong>Core Internals – A Quick Tour</strong></h3>
<p>At the heart of Sakha, there are a few key components:</p>
<section id="conversation-processor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conversation-processor"><strong>Conversation Processor</strong></h4>
<p>The entry point. It: - Takes the user’s input - Does basic preprocessing (cleaning, formatting) - Passes it through the conversation graph to get an appropriate response</p>
</section>
<section id="supervisor-node" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supervisor-node"><strong>Supervisor Node</strong></h4>
<p>The first stop in every conversation. - It determines if the bot should continue with a normal conversation or escalate to crisis support - This was important: we wanted to <em>check in</em> on users, but also not ignore red flags when they show up</p>
</section>
<section id="chat-engine" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chat-engine"><strong>Chat Engine</strong></h4>
<p>If the conversation isn’t a crisis, we route it here. - It decides which chat flow to run: <code>activity suggestion</code>, <code>reminder</code>, or <code>follow-up</code> - This modularity helps keep the system clean - Each flow exists because <em>one prompt can’t do everything</em>—we needed different instructions, behaviors, and tools depending on the use case</p>
<p>This structure helped us build conversations that felt purpose-driven while still being emotionally supportive.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next"><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h3>
<p>Sakha isn’t finished—there are plans for better testing, more flows, and richer context tracking. But the current system is functional, modular, and grounded in thoughtful decisions that balance feasibility with ambition.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In today’s fast-paced world, mental health is more important than ever. Yet, many people struggle with their emotional well-being, often facing issues alone. Stress, anxiety, and overwhelming thoughts can build up without a clear outlet, leaving individuals feeling isolated and unheard. Fortunately, there’s an old but powerful piece of advice: “<em>Talking to a friend about your problems can help.</em>” When we share our struggles, it often helps to sort through them, gain new perspectives, and release the tension that builds up over time.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that talking to someone is not a cure-all for mental health problems. If you are struggling with a serious mental health condition, it is important to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. However, talking to someone you trust can be a helpful first step in managing your mental health.</p>
<p>But not everyone has someone they can turn to when they need it most. This gap presents a significant challenge. How can we provide people with a safe, understanding space to express their feelings and navigate their mental health struggles? - Serene Solace</p>
</section>
<section id="scope" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope">Scope</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provides emotional support through empathetic, personalized conversations.</li>
<li>Maintains user confidentiality.</li>
<li>Guides user to Crisis Management helpline when required.</li>
<li>Answers company (serene solace) related questions.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="model-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection">Model Selection</h3>
<p>When deciding on the right approach to model selection for Serene Solace, two key factors must be carefully considered: whether to build a model from scratch or use pretrained models, and the financial implications of selecting an API or self-hosted solution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Build from Scratch vs.&nbsp;Use Pretrained Models</strong>: Building a model from the ground up requires significant investment in terms of time, expertise, and computational resources. This process is costly and can delay deployment. On the other hand, using pretrained models offers a practical and cost-effective solution. These models have already been trained on large datasets and are ready for fine-tuning, saving both time and resources while providing high-quality performance from the start.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API Costs vs.&nbsp;Self-Hosting</strong>: When considering the use of language models, the decision to use APIs versus hosting a model locally comes down to ongoing costs, control, and privacy. Using an API service can incur substantial recurring costs, especially as the volume of users and requests grows. These costs can add up over time, potentially making API usage less cost-effective for long-term scalability. Additionally, APIs often come with limitations on data privacy, as user data may be processed by third-party services.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, self-hosting an open-source model allows for full control over data privacy and confidentiality, which is crucial for an emotional support service. By hosting the model locally, we can ensure that sensitive information remains within the organization’s secure infrastructure, addressing privacy concerns. A viable and cost-effective option for self-hosting is the Llama 3.2:1b model, an open-source, lightweight language model. It offers a balance of performance and efficiency, reducing the need for expensive cloud API services while still providing high-quality, empathetic conversations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for Serene Solace’s focus on providing confidential, emotionally supportive conversations, using an open-source model like Llama 3.2:1b and hosting it locally proves to be both cost-effective and privacy-conscious. This solution minimizes the financial burden of API usage while ensuring user data stays secure.</p>

<section id="challenges-and-solutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-and-solutions"><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></h3>
<p>During the development of <em>Me in Moments</em>, one significant challenge was ensuring accurate facial similarity comparisons, especially when users were photographed in different lighting conditions. Simple direct comparisons between images were not providing reliable results, as lighting variations often affected the facial features.</p>
<section id="solution" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution"><strong>Solution</strong></h4>
<p>To address this, I implemented a preprocessing step using OpenCV to generate multiple versions of the images before passing them to the facial recognition model:<br>
- <strong>Gray</strong>: A standard grayscale version of the image.<br>
- <strong>Gray_he</strong>: A grayscale version with histogram equalization to improve contrast and brightness.<br>
- <strong>YUV_he</strong>: YUV color space with histogram equalization for better feature extraction.</p>
<p>These preprocessing techniques enhanced the accuracy of facial detection and similarity comparison, allowing <em>Me in Moments</em> to perform better under varying lighting conditions.</p>

<section id="future-enhancements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-enhancements"><strong>Future Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p>The current version of <em>Me in Moments</em> provides a quick and accurate facial similarity search for event photos. Moving forward, several key improvements are planned to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience:</p>
<section id="scalability" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scalability"><strong>Scalability</strong></h4>
<p>To better handle larger datasets and improve efficiency, the following improvements are in the pipeline:<br>
- <strong>Centralized Storage</strong>: Users should be able to upload photos from multiple devices to a centralized storage system, making it easier to manage large collections of event photos.<br>
- <strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Images could be processed in parallel as soon as they are uploaded, significantly speeding up the face recognition and embedding generation process.<br>
- <strong>Vector Database</strong>: Face embeddings could be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable similarity searches, even across large datasets.<br>
- <strong>Unified User Interface</strong>: The UI will be enhanced to allow users to upload reference images and search for matches across the entire event’s photo collection.</p>
