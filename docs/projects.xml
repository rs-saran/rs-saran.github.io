<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In today’s fast-paced world, mental health is more important than ever. Yet, many people struggle with their emotional well-being, often facing issues alone. Stress, anxiety, and overwhelming thoughts can build up without a clear outlet, leaving individuals feeling isolated and unheard. Fortunately, there’s an old but powerful piece of advice: “<em>Talking to a friend about your problems can help.</em>” When we share our struggles, it often helps to sort through them, gain new perspectives, and release the tension that builds up over time.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that talking to someone is not a cure-all for mental health problems. If you are struggling with a serious mental health condition, it is important to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. However, talking to someone you trust can be a helpful first step in managing your mental health.</p>
<p>But not everyone has someone they can turn to when they need it most. This gap presents a significant challenge. How can we provide people with a safe, understanding space to express their feelings and navigate their mental health struggles? - Serene Solace</p>

<section id="scope" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope">Scope</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Provides emotional support through empathetic, personalized conversations.</li>
<li>Maintains user confidentiality.</li>
<li>Guides user to Crisis Management helpline when required.</li>
<li>Answers company (serene solace) related questions.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="model-selection" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection">Model Selection</h3>
<p>When deciding on the right approach to model selection for Serene Solace, two key factors must be carefully considered: whether to build a model from scratch or use pretrained models, and the financial implications of selecting an API or self-hosted solution.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Build from Scratch vs.&nbsp;Use Pretrained Models</strong>: Building a model from the ground up requires significant investment in terms of time, expertise, and computational resources. This process is costly and can delay deployment. On the other hand, using pretrained models offers a practical and cost-effective solution. These models have already been trained on large datasets and are ready for fine-tuning, saving both time and resources while providing high-quality performance from the start.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API Costs vs.&nbsp;Self-Hosting</strong>: When considering the use of language models, the decision to use APIs versus hosting a model locally comes down to ongoing costs, control, and privacy. Using an API service can incur substantial recurring costs, especially as the volume of users and requests grows. These costs can add up over time, potentially making API usage less cost-effective for long-term scalability. Additionally, APIs often come with limitations on data privacy, as user data may be processed by third-party services.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the other hand, self-hosting an open-source model allows for full control over data privacy and confidentiality, which is crucial for an emotional support service. By hosting the model locally, we can ensure that sensitive information remains within the organization’s secure infrastructure, addressing privacy concerns. A viable and cost-effective option for self-hosting is the Llama 3.2:1b model, an open-source, lightweight language model. It offers a balance of performance and efficiency, reducing the need for expensive cloud API services while still providing high-quality, empathetic conversations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for Serene Solace’s focus on providing confidential, emotionally supportive conversations, using an open-source model like Llama 3.2:1b and hosting it locally proves to be both cost-effective and privacy-conscious. This solution minimizes the financial burden of API usage while ensuring user data stays secure.</p>

<li><p><strong>Image Input</strong><br>
Users upload a <strong>reference image</strong> and a collection of <strong>target images</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Processing</strong><br>
The <code>ImageProcessor</code> class processes each image using OpenCV to generate multiple enhanced versions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gray</strong>: Grayscale representation.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Gray_he</strong>: Grayscale with histogram equalization.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>YUV_he</strong>: YUV color space with histogram equalization.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Face Embedding and Similarity Computation</strong><br>
The <code>FaceEmbeddingService</code> plays a central role by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting faces in the processed images using DeepFace.<br>
</li>
<li>Generating embeddings (numerical representations) for each detected face.<br>
</li>
<li>Providing a similarity function to compute <strong>cosine distance</strong> between embeddings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Reference Embeddings</strong><br>
The app processes the reference image through the <code>ImageProcessor</code> and <code>FaceEmbeddingService</code>, storing embeddings for all enhanced versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Target Image Comparison</strong><br>
For each target image:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ImageProcessor</code> generates processed versions.<br>
</li>
<li>The <code>FaceEmbeddingService</code> computes embeddings for detected faces.<br>
</li>
<li>Each target embedding is compared against the reference embeddings, and the minimum similarity score is recorded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Caching and Display</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All similarity scores are cached for efficient retrieval.<br>
</li>
<li>A slider (default threshold: <strong>0.4</strong>) allows users to adjust matching sensitivity.<br>
</li>
<li>Images with similarity scores below the threshold are displayed, helping users identify relevant photos.</li>

<section id="challenges-and-solutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenges-and-solutions"><strong>Challenges and Solutions</strong></h3>
<p>During the development of <em>Me in Moments</em>, one significant challenge was ensuring accurate facial similarity comparisons, especially when users were photographed in different lighting conditions. Simple direct comparisons between images were not providing reliable results, as lighting variations often affected the facial features.</p>
<section id="solution" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution"><strong>Solution</strong></h4>
<p>To address this, I implemented a preprocessing step using OpenCV to generate multiple versions of the images before passing them to the facial recognition model:<br>
- <strong>Gray</strong>: A standard grayscale version of the image.<br>
- <strong>Gray_he</strong>: A grayscale version with histogram equalization to improve contrast and brightness.<br>
- <strong>YUV_he</strong>: YUV color space with histogram equalization for better feature extraction.</p>
<p>These preprocessing techniques enhanced the accuracy of facial detection and similarity comparison, allowing <em>Me in Moments</em> to perform better under varying lighting conditions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="future-enhancements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-enhancements"><strong>Future Enhancements</strong></h3>
<p>The current version of <em>Me in Moments</em> provides a quick and accurate facial similarity search for event photos. Moving forward, several key improvements are planned to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience:</p>
<section id="scalability" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scalability"><strong>Scalability</strong></h4>
<p>To better handle larger datasets and improve efficiency, the following improvements are in the pipeline:<br>
- <strong>Centralized Storage</strong>: Users should be able to upload photos from multiple devices to a centralized storage system, making it easier to manage large collections of event photos.<br>
- <strong>Parallel Processing</strong>: Images could be processed in parallel as soon as they are uploaded, significantly speeding up the face recognition and embedding generation process.<br>
- <strong>Vector Database</strong>: Face embeddings could be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable similarity searches, even across large datasets.<br>
- <strong>Unified User Interface</strong>: The UI will be enhanced to allow users to upload reference images and search for matches across the entire event’s photo collection.</p>
