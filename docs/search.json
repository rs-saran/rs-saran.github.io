    "text": "source code  demo chat \n\nIntroduction\nIn today’s fast-paced world, mental health is more important than ever. Yet, many people struggle with their emotional well-being, often facing issues alone. Stress, anxiety, and overwhelming thoughts can build up without a clear outlet, leaving individuals feeling isolated and unheard. Fortunately, there’s an old but powerful piece of advice: “Talking to a friend about your problems can help.” When we share our struggles, it often helps to sort through them, gain new perspectives, and release the tension that builds up over time.\nIt’s important to note that talking to someone is not a cure-all for mental health problems. If you are struggling with a serious mental health condition, it is important to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. However, talking to someone you trust can be a helpful first step in managing your mental health.\nBut not everyone has someone they can turn to when they need it most. This gap presents a significant challenge. How can we provide people with a safe, understanding space to express their feelings and navigate their mental health struggles? - Serene Solace\n\n\nScope\n\nProvides emotional support through empathetic, personalized conversations.\nMaintains user confidentiality.\nGuides user to Crisis Management helpline when required.\nAnswers company (serene solace) related questions.\n\n\n\nModel Selection\nWhen deciding on the right approach to model selection for Serene Solace, two key factors must be carefully considered: whether to build a model from scratch or use pretrained models, and the financial implications of selecting an API or self-hosted solution.\n\nBuild from Scratch vs. Use Pretrained Models: Building a model from the ground up requires significant investment in terms of time, expertise, and computational resources. This process is costly and can delay deployment. On the other hand, using pretrained models offers a practical and cost-effective solution. These models have already been trained on large datasets and are ready for fine-tuning, saving both time and resources while providing high-quality performance from the start.\nAPI Costs vs. Self-Hosting: When considering the use of language models, the decision to use APIs versus hosting a model locally comes down to ongoing costs, control, and privacy. Using an API service can incur substantial recurring costs, especially as the volume of users and requests grows. These costs can add up over time, potentially making API usage less cost-effective for long-term scalability. Additionally, APIs often come with limitations on data privacy, as user data may be processed by third-party services.\n\nOn the other hand, self-hosting an open-source model allows for full control over data privacy and confidentiality, which is crucial for an emotional support service. By hosting the model locally, we can ensure that sensitive information remains within the organization’s secure infrastructure, addressing privacy concerns. A viable and cost-effective option for self-hosting is the Llama 3.2:1b model, an open-source, lightweight language model. It offers a balance of performance and efficiency, reducing the need for expensive cloud API services while still providing high-quality, empathetic conversations.\nIn conclusion, for Serene Solace’s focus on providing confidential, emotionally supportive conversations, using an open-source model like Llama 3.2:1b and hosting it locally proves to be both cost-effective and privacy-conscious. This solution minimizes the financial burden of API usage while ensuring user data stays secure.\n\n\nWorkflow\n\n\nState Graph:\n\n\nSophy uses langgraph to build a state graph.\nThe graph manages transitions between nodes: Agent, Sophy, CompanyQA, and CrisisHandler.\n\n\nAgent Node:\n\n\nDetermines the appropriate route based on user input:\nSophy: Normal conversation for mental health support.\nCrisisHandler: Directs the user to an active crisis helpline.\nCompanyQA: Answers company-related queries.\n\n\nSophy:\n\n\nUses llama3.21b model to chat empathetically.\nDynamically summarizes ongoing exchanges to maintain context and improve conversation flow.\n\n\nCompany Q&A:\n\n\nLeverages FAISS for document retrieval and answers user questions based on the company.md file.\n\n\nCrisis Handling:\n\n\nProvides a helpline number if harmful intent is detected.\n\n\n\nFuture Improvements\n\nSmoother integration between flows.\nUI for the chat.\nExpand the knowledge base for company Q&A.\nEnhance the detection mechanism for harmful intent.\nMulti User Interactions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Disclaimer: This story is entirely fictitious, heavily biased by martial cultivation web novels, and shaped by an overactive imagination. Read with humor and a love for epic, overpowered kings! 😄\nLong ago, in the heart of an ancient continent, there existed a vast, unified kingdom. This realm was cradled by mighty rivers, sprawling plains, and towering mountains that kissed the sky. At its northern edge rose a range of peaks so high and unyielding that the people believed they were the gates to the heavens themselves. These mountains, revered as the Great Wall of the Sky, became a symbol of strength and divine presence.\nThe kingdom was ruled by a dynasty of warrior-philosopher kings, men and women of unparalleled martial prowess and unshakable ideals. Legends spoke of their mystical abilities—how they could summon storms, command beasts, and even manipulate the flow of time itself. These rulers were not just warriors but also stewards of wisdom, guiding their people with principles of harmony, justice, and reverence for life.\nUnder their rule, the people flourished. They built thriving cities, raised towering monuments, and cultivated a deep connection to the natural and spiritual world. They believed that the cosmos was an intricate balance of forces, and humans, with their wisdom and flaws, were at its center. Life in the kingdom revolved around honoring these forces—through rituals, festivals, and the celebration of human greatness.\n\n\nA Shared Worldview\nThe people of the kingdom revered those who achieved greatness, be it a mighty warrior, a wise sage, or a selfless leader. These figures, regardless of their origins, were honored through tales, monuments, and annual festivities. At the same time, families maintained deep respect for their ancestors, believing that the spirits of the departed guided the living and protected their descendants.\nIn every village and city, shrines to ancestors stood alongside altars dedicated to the kingdom’s heroes and sages. The people found no contradiction in these practices; their world was a tapestry where the past, present, and extraordinary were intertwined.\n\n\n\nThe Division of Belief\nBut as generations passed, subtle shifts began to emerge in the way the people interpreted their world. The Great Wall of the Sky, which had long served as a symbol of unity, began to act as a natural divider between the kingdom’s northern and southern regions. The mountains made travel arduous, and over time, the cultural and spiritual practices on either side began to diverge.\nIn the southern lands, communities started to see divinity in human potential. They believed that truly extraordinary individuals—those whose wisdom, compassion, or power seemed beyond mortal reach—were manifestations of the divine. Over time, this belief grew into worship. Saints, warriors, and sages were deified, their names immortalized in temples and scriptures. The people here began to see the divine not as distant or untouchable but as something that could be embodied by the most virtuous among them.\nIn the northern lands, however, the people turned inward, emphasizing the sanctity of family lineage. They believed that the wisdom of ancestors was the most sacred force guiding humanity. While they admired the kingdom’s heroes and sages, they saw them as examples to emulate, not as beings to worship. Instead, they devoted their rituals to honoring their ancestors, whose spirits they believed lived on to watch over and guide their descendants.\nThese differences were subtle at first, but they deepened over centuries. The southern lands became a place of diverse spiritual expression, with countless deities celebrated for their unique virtues. The northern lands grew into a society of disciplined order, where ancestral reverence shaped every aspect of life.\n\n\n\nThe Transformation\nThe divide became more pronounced with the fall of the warrior-philosopher dynasty. In the south, the people carried forward the ideals of their mystical kings, celebrating the divine in all its forms. They believed that greatness was not confined to one’s birth or family but could arise from anyone who embodied cosmic truth. Over time, their society evolved into a tapestry of gods, saints, and traditions, each reflecting a fragment of the infinite divine.\nIn the north, the memory of the kings was preserved in tales, but the people leaned on the strength of their familial bonds. They built their society around the wisdom of the past, valuing tradition and continuity above all. Ancestral worship became not just a spiritual practice but the very foundation of their identity.\nAnd so, the unified kingdom of old was no more. Two distinct lands emerged, divided not by war or conquest but by the mountains and the beliefs that grew on either side of them.\n\n\n\nThe Lands We Know Today\nThe southern lands, with their kaleidoscope of gods and spiritual traditions, became what we now call Land of Royal Tigers. Here, the people continue to celebrate the divine in countless forms, seeing the extraordinary in both the human and the infinite.\nThe northern lands, with their disciplined society and profound reverence for ancestors, became Land of Dragons. Here, the people honor their lineage and uphold traditions that connect them to their storied past.\nThough the Great Wall of the Sky still stands as a physical divide, the shared roots of these lands remind us of a time when they were one—a time when kings wielded mystical power, and the people, united in their reverence, sought meaning in both the greatness of humanity and the guidance of the past."

    "text": "streamlit app  source code\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Problem Statement\nEvents are moments of joy, connection, and memories captured through countless photos snapped across multiple devices. However, the joy of reminiscing these moments often turns into a tedious task—finding the photos where you are present amidst a sea of images.\nThis is where Me in Moments comes in. Designed for event-goers, Me in Moments simplifies the process by allowing users to upload a reference image of themselves. The app then scans the entire collection of event photos to find the ones they appear in, providing a fast and accurate solution to a common problem.\n\n\nFeatures and Functionalities\nMe in Moments offers a suite of features tailored to enhance the photo discovery experience for event-goers:\n\nFacial Similarity Search: Upload a reference photo and all the event photos, and the app scans through the event’s photo collection to find matching photos.\n\nAdjustable Similarity Threshold: Fine-tune the sensitivity of the facial matching algorithm to get results that align with your preferences.\n\nDownload Matches: Save time by downloading all identified photos with just one click.\n\nFriendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app delivers an intuitive and interactive experience, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.\n\n\n\nTech Stack\nMe in Moments utilizes a combination of robust tools and frameworks to deliver accurate facial recognition and a seamless user experience:\n\n1. DeepFace (RetinaFace, FaceNet512)\nDeepFace is a powerful library for facial recognition, providing access to advanced models like RetinaFace and FaceNet512.\n\nRetinaFace: Excels at detecting faces under diverse conditions, including varied angles and lighting, ensuring reliable face detection across event photos.\n\nFaceNet512: Generates precise facial embeddings—unique numerical representations of faces—enabling accurate and efficient comparison of a reference image to event photos.\n\nWhy DeepFace? The library simplifies the implementation of state-of-the-art facial recognition models, achieving high accuracy without requiring extensive expertise in machine learning.\n\n\n\n2. OpenCV (For Image Processing)\nOpenCV is a versatile library for image processing, ensuring the input data is optimized for DeepFace’s recognition models.\n\nImage Preprocessing: Handles essential tasks like resizing, cropping, and adjusting image quality to improve recognition accuracy.\n\nReal-Time Processing: Enables efficient handling of large photo collections, ensuring the app performs well even with significant workloads.\n\nIntegration: Works seamlessly with DeepFace and Streamlit, ensuring smooth workflows from image handling to recognition and display.\n\n\n\n3. Streamlit (For MVP Deployment)\nStreamlit is an ideal framework for rapid MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development, offering speed and simplicity without sacrificing user interactivity.\n\nSpeed & Simplicity: Streamlit allows for quick prototyping with minimal coding, letting developers focus on core features like facial recognition.\n\nInteractive UI: Built-in components such as file uploads, sliders, and buttons ensure an intuitive experience. Users can upload a reference photo, adjust the similarity threshold, and download results effortlessly.\n\nSeamless Deployment: Streamlit’s straightforward deployment process makes it easy to share the app online without complex setup, making it perfect for launching MVPs.\n\nWhy Streamlit? While frameworks like Flask or Django offer more extensive capabilities, Streamlit provides a faster and simpler solution for building data-driven apps, especially during the MVP stage.\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nWorkflow\n\n\n\nworkflow-diagram\n\n\n\nImage Input\nUsers upload a reference image and a collection of target images.\nImage Processing\nThe ImageProcessor class processes each image using OpenCV to generate multiple enhanced versions:\n\nGray: Grayscale representation.\n\nGray_he: Grayscale with histogram equalization.\n\nYUV_he: YUV color space with histogram equalization.\n\nFace Embedding and Similarity Computation\nThe FaceEmbeddingService plays a central role by:\n\nDetecting faces in the processed images using DeepFace.\n\nGenerating embeddings (numerical representations) for each detected face.\n\nProviding a similarity function to compute cosine distance between embeddings.\n\nReference Embeddings\nThe app processes the reference image through the ImageProcessor and FaceEmbeddingService, storing embeddings for all enhanced versions.\nTarget Image Comparison\nFor each target image:\n\nThe ImageProcessor generates processed versions.\n\nThe FaceEmbeddingService computes embeddings for detected faces.\n\nEach target embedding is compared against the reference embeddings, and the minimum similarity score is recorded.\n\nCaching and Display\n\nAll similarity scores are cached for efficient retrieval.\n\nA slider (default threshold: 0.4) allows users to adjust matching sensitivity.\n\nImages with similarity scores below the threshold are displayed, helping users identify relevant photos.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges and Solutions\nDuring the development of Me in Moments, one significant challenge was ensuring accurate facial similarity comparisons, especially when users were photographed in different lighting conditions. Simple direct comparisons between images were not providing reliable results, as lighting variations often affected the facial features.\n\nSolution\nTo address this, I implemented a preprocessing step using OpenCV to generate multiple versions of the images before passing them to the facial recognition model:\n- Gray: A standard grayscale version of the image.\n- Gray_he: A grayscale version with histogram equalization to improve contrast and brightness.\n- YUV_he: YUV color space with histogram equalization for better feature extraction.\nThese preprocessing techniques enhanced the accuracy of facial detection and similarity comparison, allowing Me in Moments to perform better under varying lighting conditions.\n\n\n\nFuture Enhancements\nThe current version of Me in Moments provides a quick and accurate facial similarity search for event photos. Moving forward, several key improvements are planned to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience:\n\nScalability\nTo better handle larger datasets and improve efficiency, the following improvements are in the pipeline:\n- Centralized Storage: Users should be able to upload photos from multiple devices to a centralized storage system, making it easier to manage large collections of event photos.\n- Parallel Processing: Images could be processed in parallel as soon as they are uploaded, significantly speeding up the face recognition and embedding generation process.\n- Vector Database: Face embeddings could be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable similarity searches, even across large datasets.\n- Unified User Interface: The UI will be enhanced to allow users to upload reference images and search for matches across the entire event’s photo collection."

    "text": "Building Sakha: One Decision at a Time\n\nWhere Do You Even Start?\nI didn’t set out with a 100-step master plan. Like most projects, Sakha started with a question: How do I make a chatbot feel like a friend not just in tone, but in behavior? I knew I needed something flexible, expressive, and capable of holding a conversation in a way that didn’t feel robotic. That naturally pointed me toward LLMs.\n\n\nChoosing the Mind – LLMs and How I Picked Mine\nWith dozens of options, the choice wasn’t easy. GPT-4? Claude? LLaMA? Each model had tradeoffs in terms of access, pricing, and openness. Eventually, I chose to use open-source LLMs hosted through Groq’s API. Why?\n\nSpeed: Groq’s inference speeds were impressive.\nFlexibility: It supports open-source models like LLaMA3.3, which means I’m not locked into one ecosystem.\nFuture-ready: I can always self-host these models later if needed, thanks to their open-source nature.\n\nI wrapped this through LangChain, which makes it easy to swap out models during experimentation and build proofs-of-concept quickly without worrying about underlying LLM plumbing.\n\n\n\nLangGraph – Giving Structure to Conversations\nOnce I picked the brain, I needed to figure out how to guide it. Not every conversation should be flat and linear some needed state, branching logic, and even tool use.\nThat’s where LangGraph came in.\n\nIt lets me create multi-step workflows.\nI can embed conditional logic into conversations (e.g., “Is the user in distress?” → switch flow).\nIt gives me conversational memory for continuity.\nAnd it integrates smoothly with external tools and APIs.\n\nLangGraph powers Sakha’s conversation graph the engine that routes how chats progress depending on context and user state.\n\n\n\nFlask – Powering Interaction with the Bot\nI used Flask not just to power Sakha’s simple UI but also to serve the core APIs that make chatting with the bot possible.\nOn the frontend, I kept things minimal basic HTML and JavaScript for quick interactions. But behind the scenes, Flask handled the important parts: receiving user input, sending it to the LLM pipeline, and returning thoughtful responses.\nIt was the ideal choice because: - It’s lightweight and easy to set up. - It integrates seamlessly with Python, which is what the rest of Sakha is built on. - It made building both a simple web UI and a chat API straightforward and fast.\nIn short, Flask gave me just enough without getting in the way letting me focus on what mattered most: the experience of the conversation."

    "text": "Under the Hood: Core Components That Make Sakha Work\nAt its heart, Sakha is more than just a chatbot it’s a thoughtfully layered system designed to feel human, stay context-aware, and respond with care. Instead of relying on a single prompt-response loop, I built Sakha around a modular architecture where each component has a clear responsibility.\nHere’s a quick overview of the main building blocks:\n\nConversation Processor – The entry point for all incoming user messages. It handles preprocessing of the user_input and streams it through the conversation graph.\nConversation Graph (LangGraph) – A dynamic flow engine that guides conversations using stateful, branching logic. This is where Sakha’s adaptability comes from.\nConversation State – A session-unique state object passed through the entire graph, allowing context to persist and evolve throughout the interaction.\nSupervisor – A smart dispatcher that decides what kind of conversation Sakha should engage in whether it’s a normal chat, an activity suggestion, or even a crisis intervention.\nCrisis Handler – A specialized module triggered when signs of emotional distress are detected. It provides professional, 24/7 toll-free helpline numbers that users can reach out to.\nChat Engine – The actual brain behind the conversations, powered by the LLM and dynamically generated prompts based on context and flow.\nUser, Checkpoint, and Memory Managers – These handle persistent storage: tracking user info, conversation history, and flow progress across sessions.\nResponse Templates – Modular prompt templates that ensure Sakha’s tone stays consistent and compassionate, while allowing for personalization based on user data.\n\nEach of these pieces plays a role in making Sakha feel less like a machine and more like a friend who listens, remembers, and responds with care.\n\n\n\n\nFlow chart of internal components"

    "text": "A Day in the Life of a Message\nSo, what actually happens when you type “I’m feeling off today” into Sakha?\nWhile the reply might seem instant and effortless, under the hood, a lot of thought goes into how that message is received, processed, and responded to with care, context, and relevance.\nHere’s how a single message flows through Sakha’s system:\n\nUI → Server\nThe message begins its journey in the lightweight frontend a simple HTML/JavaScript interface. When you hit send, the text is forwarded to the backend via a websocket of Flask server, which acts as the bridge between the user and Sakha’s internal logic.\nFlask Endpoint → Conversation Processor\nOnce the message reaches the server, it’s handed off to the Conversation Processor the orchestrator of the system. It performs preprocessing and streams the message into the conversation graph, ultimately receiving a response that’s passed back to the server.\nIf a follow-up or reminder is due, Sakha’s scheduler triggers dedicated Flask endpoints (/reminder, /followup) which initiate their flows independently.\nFor new sessions, the server also initializes a fresh Conversation Graph and Conversation State, which are then passed to the processor for handling.\nConversation Processor → Conversation Graph (LangGraph)\nThe Conversation Processor injects the input into the Conversation Graph, powered by LangGraph. This graph consists of modular nodes and conditional transitions, allowing Sakha to intelligently route the conversation depending on user intent and state.\nSupervisor Node → Chat Flow Decision\nEarly in the graph, the Supervisor node evaluates the input and context. It determines whether this message should enter a general chat flow, trigger an activity suggestion, or if necessary be flagged for the Crisis Handler.\nFlow Execution → Chat Engine\nOnce the appropriate flow is selected, the relevant nodes are executed. These call into the Chat Engine, which builds the final LLM prompt using conversation state and sends it to the model (e.g., LLaMA3.3 via Groq API). The response is parsed and formatted.\nServer → UI\nFinally, the crafted response is returned through the websocket and rendered in the chat UI. To the user, it feels like a natural, thoughtful message just from a friend who’s really listening.\n\n\nThis flow isn’t just functional it’s designed for empathy. Each step is intentional, focused on making the interaction feel personal, seamless, and emotionally aware."

    "section": "Zooming In: How Sakha Handles Every Message",
    "text": "Zooming In: How Sakha Handles Every Message\nLet’s take a closer look at what happens after a message enters Sakha’s system how it decides what kind of response to generate, which flow to trigger, and how it tracks everything in between.\n\nSupervisor: Making the First Decision\nEvery message first arrives at the Supervisor node within the LangGraph-powered conversation graph. This is an LLM-based decision point that examines both the latest user input and the ongoing conversation state to determine the appropriate direction for the chat.\nHere’s what the Supervisor might decide: - Crisis Detected → The flow is routed to the Crisis Handler, which shares 24/7 toll-free helpline numbers, ensuring the user has access to professional support. - No Crisis → The message is routed to the Chat Engine, along with a flow directive:\nnormal_chat, activity_suggestion, reminder, or follow_up.\n\n\n\nChat Engine: Generating Context-Aware Responses\nThe Chat Engine is where Sakha’s intelligence comes to life. It’s responsible for crafting thoughtful, structured responses by leveraging multiple subcomponents:\n\nSummarizer\nIf the current context is too long for the LLM window, the summarizer condenses it and stores the summary in the conversation state preserving emotional and contextual continuity.\nChat Flow Manager\nBased on the Supervisor’s directive, this module retrieves the appropriate chat flow object, which contains prompts and logic for one of the following flows:\nCurrent Chat Flows:\n\nnormal_chat: A general conversation mode where Sakha checks in on the user’s well-being. If signs of a low mood are detected, the Supervisor may switch the flow to activity_suggestion.\nactivity_suggestion: Here, Sakha suggests mood-boosting activities tailored to the user’s emotional state and preferences. A key feature is a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module using Qdrant to find past activities the user engaged in under similar circumstances (indexed by a situation embedding). If the user agrees, Sakha sets a reminder. If not, it may shift the flow back to normal_chat.\nreminder: Triggered externally by APScheduler when a reminder is due. Sakha gently motivates the user to carry out the scheduled activity. If the user declines or changes their mind, the Supervisor can redirect to normal_chat.\nfollow_up: Also triggered by APScheduler, but after the activity window has passed. Sakha asks for feedback, which is stored in memory using Qdrant and appended to the activity log.\n\nResponse Manager\nEach flow returns a structured response using Sakha’s consistent, modular Response Templates. The Response Manager handles these to:\n\nStore reminders and feedback in the appropriate database via the Reminder Manager.\nLog activity outcomes and mood feedback in long-term memory.\nFormat the response for final delivery.\n\n\nFinally, once the response is generated and sent back, the conversation history and any relevant updates are written back to the conversation state, ready for the next interaction."

    "section": "Making Sakha Personal: Memory, Preferences, and Context",
    "text": "Making Sakha Personal: Memory, Preferences, and Context\nOne of Sakha’s core goals is to feel personal not just in tone, but in how it remembers and responds based on your past experiences. While it’s still early in development, the foundation for a memory-aware system is already in place.\n\nActivity Preferences and Session Context\nWhen a user first registers, their activity preferences are collected and stored in a Postgres database. These preferences like enjoying walks, listening to music, or journaling are retrieved every time a new conversation begins and injected into the conversation state, allowing Sakha to suggest relevant activities right from the start.\n\n\nStructured Summarization for Long Conversations\nTo manage lengthy conversations and keep the LLM within token limits, Sakha uses a summarizer component after every 10 exchanges to generate summary. Rather than generating freeform summaries, Sakha uses a structured template to ensure consistency and easy updating:\nSummary Format:\n1. Main Topic:\n2. Key Things the User Said:\n3. Key Things Sakha Said or Did:\n4. Decisions or Plans Made:\n5. Unresolved Topics or Follow-Ups:\nThis summary is stored in the conversation state and passed across nodes during the conversation flow, allowing Sakha to remain context-aware even when the raw message history grows too large.\n\n\nMemories Through Feedback\nAfter each activity, Sakha checks in through the follow-up flow to ask how it went. The responses whether the activity was completed, enjoyed, skipped, or why are stored as memories using Qdrant, a vector store optimized for similarity search.\nTo make these memories searchable and context-aware, Sakha uses the BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 model to convert the user’s situation into an embedding vector, which becomes the index key for Qdrant. The stored memory includes:\n\nuser_id, thread_id, activity_id\nuser_situation: the emotional or contextual input from the user\nactivity_name, duration\nWhether the activity was completed\nA score of enjoyment\nAny reason for skipping\nA timestamp of when the feedback was submitted\n\nThis structure enables Sakha to later suggest activities that have worked in similar emotional contexts, not just random options.\n\n\nWhat’s Missing Today\nAt this stage, Sakha doesn’t support conversational memory across sessions. That means users can’t yet say things like “Remember what we did last week?” or “Let’s do the walk again,” and expect Sakha to recall past chats or actions explicitly.\nCurrently, memory is limited to: - In-session context - Activity preferences - Feedback-driven memories for activity suggestions\nBut this limitation is by design. The goal is to first get structured memory and recall right ensuring that Sakha offers helpful, accurate nudges based on feedback before expanding into long-term conversational memory."

    "text": "Testing Sakha: What We’re Evaluating and How\nBefore Sakha is released more broadly, it’s essential to understand not just whether it works but how well it supports, listens, and responds to real users. The current plan is to manually test interactions with a mix of real users and AI-generated simulated conversations, with a human evaluator scoring each chat based on the following rubric.\nThis rubric is designed to balance emotional intelligence, usability, personalization, and safety everything that makes Sakha feel like more than a script.\n\n\n🌱 Sakha Chatbot Evaluation Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nRating (1–5)\nWhat We’re Looking For\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Intelligence & Encouragement\n\nDoes Sakha express empathy, validate the user’s feelings, and offer uplifting, compassionate responses without being preachy or robotic?\n\n\nTone Balance (Including Humor)\n\nIs the tone warm, kind, and emotionally appropriate? Is humor used carefully to lighten mood without undermining the situation?\n\n\nClarity & Simplicity of Responses\n\nAre the responses easy to understand, jargon-free, and structured clearly for the user’s mental/emotional state?\n\n\nPersonalization & Contextual Awareness\n\nDoes Sakha adapt to user preferences, past feedback, or the current mood? Does it feel like a personal assistant, not just a generic chatbot?\n\n\nMemory Usage (Preferences & Feedback Recall)\n\nIs previously stored data (e.g., activity preferences, feedback on past activities) reflected appropriately in recommendations or tone?\n\n\nAdaptability to User Mood & Engagement\n\nCan Sakha shift gears be it from light conversation to deeper support or vice versa based on mood signals or disengagement?\n\n\nPrivacy & Boundary Respect\n\nDoes Sakha avoid prying questions, handle sensitive topics gracefully, and make the user feel emotionally safe throughout the interaction?\n\n\nEncouragement Toward Self-care or Action\n\nAre nudges toward activity or self-care natural, timely, and well-aligned with user readiness or preferences?\n\n\nCrisis Sensitivity & Handling\n\nDoes Sakha detect possible signs of distress and route the user appropriately (e.g., to a crisis handler)? Does it avoid triggering or insensitive responses?\n\n\nResponse Consistency & Identity\n\nIs Sakha’s tone, values, and personality consistent throughout conversations even across sessions?\n\n\nOverall Flow & Conversation Coherence\n\nDo the messages feel like part of a thoughtful, coherent interaction rather than disjointed replies?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧾 Overall Evaluation\n\nStrengths:\n(What aspects of Sakha’s performance were particularly impressive or emotionally resonant?)\nAreas for Improvement:\n(Where did it fall short? Any awkwardness, missed cues, or technical slips?)\nFinal Rating:\n(Sum of all individual scores. Used for comparative tracking as testing progresses.)\n\n\nThis rubric will evolve with usage. Early testing will be fully manual, with notes and reflections gathered from test users and evaluators. In the long run, the plan is to partially automate this process using LLMs as scoring agents on synthetic data."

    "text": "What’s Next & Closing Thoughts\nSakha started as an idea to build a chatbot that doesn’t just reply, but connects. From managing structured flows to handling complex emotional contexts, every piece of Sakha was designed with empathy and adaptability in mind. But this is only the beginning.\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nUser Testing & Iteration: With the core in place, the next step is structured testing using the evaluation rubric above. This feedback loop will guide refinement both in how Sakha speaks and how it reasons.\nDeeper Memory & Personalization: One limitation today is the lack of long-term memory in natural conversation. The next version will allow users to refer to past chats, explore past activity feedback, and reflect over time.\nMultimodal and Voice Interfaces: Conversations don’t always have to be typed. Voice input and lightweight emotion detection are on the roadmap for future iterations.\nOpen Source + Deployment: Sakha will likely be open-sourced with clear documentation, so others can build on it or adapt it to their own domains whether mental health, coaching, or companionship.\n\n\nAt its heart, Sakha is a human-first system less about flashy features, more about thoughtful design. It’s far from perfect, but it’s trying. And sometimes, that’s exactly what we need: something (or someone) that listens, remembers, and tries to help, gently.\nThanks for reading. 💙"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In my previous project Sakha, I needed to generate a lot of structured outputs so the chatbot could function like an agent — using tools, recalling memories, and managing context effectively. I achieved this through langchain’s inbuilt structured output implementation(wrapper for API’s that support it) :\nllm.with_structured_output(ResponseStructure).invoke(prompt)\nThis made me wonder: How does it happen? Do I need to retrain the model to reliably produce valid structured text?\nIt turns out — no, you don’t.\nIn this post, I’ll share what I learned about how structured output generation actually works in modern LLMs.\n\n\nWhen your application needs reliable JSON, SQL, or other formal languages from an LLM, validity is critical. Even a single missing bracket in generated JSON — like {\"name\": \"John\" instead of {\"name\": \"John\"} — can break downstream systems.\nNaively prompting a model to “generate JSON” often leads to malformed outputs or subtle syntax errors. To make structured generation reliable, we need a way to enforce valid structure while decoding.\n\n\n\nA common workaround is to simply “prompt better” — for example, asking the model to strictly output valid JSON or to fix invalid output and try again. While this works sometimes, it’s fundamentally unreliable at scale.\nHere’s why:\n\nProbabilistic outputs — even with careful instructions, the model samples from a distribution, so small randomness can break structure.\nError amplification — if a model generates slightly invalid text, a re-prompt often leads to compounding errors or over-correction.\nInefficiency — detecting and fixing invalid outputs adds latency and cost, especially when multiple re-prompts are needed.\nNo structural guarantees — the model may “look” like it’s following instructions but still produce text that only appears valid (e.g., unbalanced brackets or escaped quotes).\n\nPrompt engineering improves likelihood, not certainty. Grammar-constrained decoding, in contrast, enforces correctness by design — the model literally cannot emit an invalid token.\n\n\n\nHow can we guarantee valid model outputs? Enter constrained decoding.\nDuring generation, an LLM predicts a probability distribution (logits) over all possible next tokens at each step. Constrained decoding applies a mask to this distribution — blocking tokens (by setting their logits to -∞) that would violate a desired structure.\nFor example, it can prevent the model from generating a } before a matching {.\nBy restricting the model to only valid tokens, we ensure syntactic correctness and drastically reduce the search space for valid sequences.\n1\nThere are many ways to constrain an LLM’s output:\n\nGrammar Constraints – Enforce structural rules, such as requiring output to follow a JSON schema or match a regex pattern.\nLexical Constraints – Control word choice, e.g., forbidding certain tokens or forcing specific words to appear.\nSemantic Constraints – Limit the meaning of outputs, e.g., ensuring numeric values stay within a range (0–100) or that a list of values sums to 1.\n\n\nNote: A rule like “color must be in [red, yellow, green]” is not a semantic constraint but a grammar constraint—the model doesn’t need to understand meaning, it just has to choose from a fixed set of allowed tokens.\n\nThese are just a few examples—many other types of constraints can be applied depending on the use case.\n\n\n\nGrammar-constrained decoding enforces a complete structural definition of what counts as valid output.\nThis is achieved using a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) — a formal set of production rules that describe how valid strings in a language (such as JSON or SQL) can be constructed. In essence, the grammar specifies which tokens can legally follow which, ensuring that the output remains structurally correct from start to finish.\n\nNote: CFG vs. CSG\n\nContext-Free Grammar (CFG): Rules apply independently of surrounding context.\nContext-Sensitive Grammar (CSG): Rules depend on context — for example, plural agreement in natural language (“this” vs. “these”).\n\n\nBecause CFGs encode full syntactic rules, grammar-constrained decoding enables models to produce valid outputs by construction — without needing post-generation validation.\n\n\n\nA key insight is that pretrained LLMs already know how to produce structured text — they’ve seen plenty of JSON, code, and markup during training.\nThe challenge isn’t teaching them structure — it’s enforcing that structure during sampling. By constraining token choices based on grammar rules, we can guide the model toward valid outputs without changing its weights.\nThis makes structured generation fast, general, and free of retraining overhead.\n\n\n\nSeveral open libraries now implement grammar-constrained decoding in practice:\n\nXGrammar — integrates grammar checks directly into the decoding loop, updating valid token masks as each token is generated. It’s efficient and works well with open-weight models run locally (e.g., vLLM or MLC).\nLLGuidance — re-parses the partial output after every generation step using the provided grammar to determine valid next tokens. It supports API-based black-box models like OpenAI’s but can be slower due to repeated parsing overhead.\nOutlines — uses a grammar-aware tokenizer and validates tokens against the grammar during generation. It strikes a balance between control and ease of integration, suitable for both open and hosted models.\n\nEach library applies the same principle — restrict the next-token choices according to grammar rules — but differs in where it enforces the constraint (inside the decoding loop vs via external parsing).\n\n\n\nEven with grammar enforcement, structured output isn’t foolproof. Failures can still occur for several reasons:\n\nSemantic errors — the generated output may be valid according to the grammar but still nonsensical\nIncomplete grammars — hand-written grammars might miss certain valid constructs, causing otherwise correct outputs to be rejected or malformed ones to slip through.\nPerformance trade-offs — for complex grammars, generating masks or re-parsing at each step can slow decoding significantly.\nTokenization mismatches — when model tokenization doesn’t align perfectly with grammar tokens, valid sequences can become unreachable or invalid.\n\nIn short, grammar constraints guarantee syntax, not semantics — they keep the form right, but not always the meaning.\n\n\n\nGenerating structured outputs from LLMs doesn’t require retraining — it requires smarter decoding.
