For me, that’s my Strava data (yes, I do recognize that that might sound a bit silly) – I’m fortunate enough to have near-immediate access to some of the greatest hiking trails around (yes, I also recognize that I’m totally biased), and spending my free time romping around our local mountains has been so important for my mental health. So, when I was ready to do my first real deep-dive into learning how to build Shiny apps and dashboards, I knew these were the data I needed to use.\n\nThis is very much an ongoing work in-progress, but the first version included a “Gear Garage” for tracking mileage on my hiking boots and bike, an activity heat map of all recorded hikes, bike rides, and walks, visualizations for exploring activity distance and elevation gain, and an interactive table of the raw data.\nThere are many more visualizations and features I’d love to add (but have been severely lacking the time to do so). I also still manually retrieve new activities using the Strava API via the {rStrava} package, but I hope to automate this in the next version. Stay tuned!\n\n\n\nCathedral Peak, Santa Barbara, CA"

    "text": "streamlit app  source code\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Problem Statement\nEvents are moments of joy, connection, and memories captured through countless photos snapped across multiple devices. However, the joy of reminiscing these moments often turns into a tedious task—finding the photos where you are present amidst a sea of images.\nThis is where Me in Moments comes in. Designed for event-goers, Me in Moments simplifies the process by allowing users to upload a reference image of themselves. The app then scans the entire collection of event photos to find the ones they appear in, providing a fast and accurate solution to a common problem.\n\n\nFeatures and Functionalities\nMe in Moments offers a suite of features tailored to enhance the photo discovery experience for event-goers:\n\nFacial Similarity Search: Upload a reference photo and all the event photos, and the app scans through the event’s photo collection to find matching photos.\n\nAdjustable Similarity Threshold: Fine-tune the sensitivity of the facial matching algorithm to get results that align with your preferences.\n\nDownload Matches: Save time by downloading all identified photos with just one click.\n\nFriendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app delivers an intuitive and interactive experience, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.\n\n\n\nTech Stack\nMe in Moments utilizes a combination of robust tools and frameworks to deliver accurate facial recognition and a seamless user experience:\n\n1. DeepFace (RetinaFace, FaceNet512)\nDeepFace is a powerful library for facial recognition, providing access to advanced models like RetinaFace and FaceNet512.\n\nRetinaFace: Excels at detecting faces under diverse conditions, including varied angles and lighting, ensuring reliable face detection across event photos.\n\nFaceNet512: Generates precise facial embeddings—unique numerical representations of faces—enabling accurate and efficient comparison of a reference image to event photos.\n\nWhy DeepFace? The library simplifies the implementation of state-of-the-art facial recognition models, achieving high accuracy without requiring extensive expertise in machine learning.\n\n\n\n2. OpenCV (For Image Processing)\nOpenCV is a versatile library for image processing, ensuring the input data is optimized for DeepFace’s recognition models.\n\nImage Preprocessing: Handles essential tasks like resizing, cropping, and adjusting image quality to improve recognition accuracy.\n\nReal-Time Processing: Enables efficient handling of large photo collections, ensuring the app performs well even with significant workloads.\n\nIntegration: Works seamlessly with DeepFace and Streamlit, ensuring smooth workflows from image handling to recognition and display.\n\n\n\n3. Streamlit (For MVP Deployment)\nStreamlit is an ideal framework for rapid MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development, offering speed and simplicity without sacrificing user interactivity.\n\nSpeed & Simplicity: Streamlit allows for quick prototyping with minimal coding, letting developers focus on core features like facial recognition.\n\nInteractive UI: Built-in components such as file uploads, sliders, and buttons ensure an intuitive experience. Users can upload a reference photo, adjust the similarity threshold, and download results effortlessly.\n\nSeamless Deployment: Streamlit’s straightforward deployment process makes it easy to share the app online without complex setup, making it perfect for launching MVPs.\n\nWhy Streamlit? While frameworks like Flask or Django offer more extensive capabilities, Streamlit provides a faster and simpler solution for building data-driven apps, especially during the MVP stage.\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nMVP Workflow\n\nImage Input\nUsers upload a reference image and a collection of target images.\nImage Processing\nThe ImageProcessor class processes each image using OpenCV to generate multiple enhanced versions:\n\nGray: Grayscale representation.\n\nGray_he: Grayscale with histogram equalization.\n\nYUV_he: YUV color space with histogram equalization.\n\nFace Embedding and Similarity Computation\nThe FaceEmbeddingService plays a central role by:\n\nDetecting faces in the processed images using DeepFace.\n\nGenerating embeddings (numerical representations) for each detected face.\n\nProviding a similarity function to compute cosine distance between embeddings.\n\nReference Embeddings\nThe app processes the reference image through the ImageProcessor and FaceEmbeddingService, storing embeddings for all enhanced versions.\nTarget Image Comparison\nFor each target image:\n\nThe ImageProcessor generates processed versions.\n\nThe FaceEmbeddingService computes embeddings for detected faces.\n\nEach target embedding is compared against the reference embeddings, and the minimum similarity score is recorded.\n\nCaching and Display\n\nAll similarity scores are cached for efficient retrieval.\n\nA slider (default threshold: 0.4) allows users to adjust matching sensitivity.\n\nImages with similarity scores below the threshold are displayed, helping users identify relevant photos.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges and Solutions\nDuring the development of Me in Moments, one significant challenge was ensuring accurate facial similarity comparisons, especially when users were photographed in different lighting conditions. Simple direct comparisons between images were not providing reliable results, as lighting variations often affected the facial features.\n\nSolution\nTo address this, I implemented a preprocessing step using OpenCV to generate multiple versions of the images before passing them to the facial recognition model:\n- Gray: A standard grayscale version of the image.\n- Gray_he: A grayscale version with histogram equalization to improve contrast and brightness.\n- YUV_he: YUV color space with histogram equalization for better feature extraction.\nThese preprocessing techniques enhanced the accuracy of facial detection and similarity comparison, allowing Me in Moments to perform better under varying lighting conditions.\n\n\n\nFuture Enhancements\nThe current version of Me in Moments provides a quick and accurate facial similarity search for event photos. Moving forward, several key improvements are planned to enhance scalability, performance, and user experience:\n\n1. Scalability\nTo better handle larger datasets and improve efficiency, the following improvements are in the pipeline:\n- Centralized Storage: Users will be able to upload photos from multiple devices to a centralized storage system, making it easier to manage large collections of event photos.\n- Parallel Processing: Images will be processed in parallel as soon as they are uploaded, significantly speeding up the face recognition and embedding generation process.\n- Vector Database: Face embeddings will be stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable similarity searches, even across large datasets.\n- Unified User Interface: The UI will be enhanced to allow users to upload reference images and search for matches across the entire event’s photo collection."
