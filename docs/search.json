    "text": "Hobby\nI’m a huge fan of martial cultivation stories, especially mangas, manhwas, and web novels. There’s just something about the mix of intense action, character growth, and world-building that really pulls me in. I love watching a protagonist start out small, slowly mastering their skills, and then seeing them face epic battles as they grow stronger. It’s the kind of story that can keep me hooked for hours. Every universe feels so unique, and I enjoy following the characters as they push their limits and discover what they’re truly capable of."
